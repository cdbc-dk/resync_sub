	Resync Subtitles - SubRip format (*.srt)


	Slide all subs starting point along by a given interval, 
	calculate the other values. 
	Version 1: In the beginning, only support for srt files.
	Later versions will cater for other formats.



{
1)	Read subtitle file *.srt

2)	Parse file into unique objects with timestamp. (*)

3)	Push or pull all individual subs along by a given factor. (ex.: 752 ms.)

4)	Keep track of the individual durations and calculate sub-ends accordingly.

5)	Rename Old file to *.bak.

6)	Write the new resync'ed subs to *.srt file.

}





(*)	1)	Load subtitle file into a stringlist.
	2)	If the last line in file is not an empty line, add one.
	3)	Scan through the entire file.
	4)	If we hit an empty line, we are in state => smNew,
		smNEw:	If we have a valid object, add it to the list of entries. Create a new entry.
		        Move to state => smId.
		smId:	We read the integer on that line into object.Id field. Move to state => smTime.
		smTime:	We read the two time entries into object.Start and object.Done fields. Calculate object.Duration.
			Move to state => smText.
		smText:	We read the line we're at into the object.Text.Add(Line). 
			Stay in smText state.

TODO:

done	1)	add support for subsection resync'in, between two id's.
	2)	Add support for merging two subtitle-files into one, refitting id's and time-sync.
	3)	Add support for *.sub files (frame counted) and eventually conversion between the two formats.

done    When merging two files:
        1) set 'merging' property to true.
        2) load and parse the first file.
        3) save the last 'Id' and 'Starttime'.
        4) load and parse the second file into the same list.
        5) resync the second half, with factor=saved starttime, entrypoint=saved id and
           exitpoint=list.count-1.
        6) save the two files to 'filename.new'
